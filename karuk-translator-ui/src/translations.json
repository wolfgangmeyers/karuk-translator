I held him down with my gun. Then I grabbed him by the head and shoved him into a sack. I packed him back up the hill to that log. There I sat down and waited a while. I was just starting down again. I heard a growl. I thought it must be the mother, but I didn't know where the sound came from. Then I saw the log lying there. The log was hollow. And the growling came from inside. Then I went to the log. I poked a stick in. But it was too short. I climbed up on the hill and there I cut a long pole. I looked back just in time to see a coyote pup running back into the log. I took my little pole and climbed down. And found the little pup I'd been packing had got away already.  I stuck my pole into the hole. I could hear them growling. Then I split the end of the pole. After poking around a good while, I caught one by the leg and twisted him out of the hole. I put him in the sack. I put him in the sack. Then I tried quite a\n\t\twhile. I had the luck to catch another and twist him through the hole. I put him in the sack too. Later I twisted out a third one. And put him in the sack. The rest were growling inside. But I was getting tired and I was hungry besides. I took my hunting knife and began chiselling. Finally I made a hole through. And I could see more pups inside. Good. I kept on and made the hole large enough.\n After a while it was big enough that\n\t\tI could pull one out. I put him in the sack with the rest. Then I dragged out another one. And there was one more still inside. Then I pulled out that one too. There they were, six little coyotes!"

He was about to climb over the ridge on the other side of the\n                    creek. I took a shot at him. Then he gave a jump down, but it was very far away. I didn't think it (my shot) reached him there. I shot under, and he jumped over the ridge. Then I went in that direction. I saw that he had run downhill on the other side. Then I climbed uphill and finally I climbed over the hill\n                    top. Then I went along the ridge. No tracks anywhere. Then I went around to the steep side. There he was, standing below me. So I shot at him. A little downhill I heard a noise in the brush. I went toward it. There he lay, a big buck. I tugged at it So then I gutted him. Then, in addition, I cut off his neck. So I packed it on my back. I could scarcely get up. I could hardly pack it any distance at all, before (I had to put\n                    it) down again. Then, after a while, I packed it on my back again and\n                    rose. Later, it became heavier. Then I thought I should skin him soon, so I skinned him. Then I made a pack of only meat. Then I packed it. My pack was becoming too round, so it kept rolling off me. I fell down somewhere. By luck, I once again get up on my feet. Finally I rolled it down.  Only the brush was moving.
